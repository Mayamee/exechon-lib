# Exechon open library
`Forward` and `Inverse` Kinematics of Exechon Robot using `MATLAB`
# How to install
Open terminal in your folder and type:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mayamee/exechon-lib
```
# How to use
You can see the folder named `model`

Here is model of mechanism, using `SOLIDWORKS 2020` you can open this model and use it for yourself.

`xoy_inverse` is function that allow you solve inverse kinematics task in one click.
`forward` allows solving the forward kinematics task.

Syntax you can see in `example file`.
